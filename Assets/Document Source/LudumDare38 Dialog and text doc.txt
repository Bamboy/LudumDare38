Intro 
101
Welcome, Space Explorer. I am your conscience and your passion. I impel you to explore the nearest regions of farthest space!

But how will you leave your Hōm?

Hōm (200)

201 Forest description:
This is a peaceful tree in a peaceful forest. He never did anything to hurt anyone. He is full of branches.


202 HouseDesc:
This is your Hōm on Hōm. It has a nice fireplace and all the hygeiene implements you use to get ready in the morning.

Your attic is full of many tools to solve many problems. But you almost never have any problems.

203 Carrot Patch Desc:

This is your garden. Without it on this tiny Hōm world, you would starve!

204 Bunny desc:

This is your friend Nün, your favorite goat in the whole universe. Nün has been sad lately.

205 Cat desc:

Puppy is a Senator and has a very important job governing your Hōm. What’s this? Puppy has hurt herself while floating in the geyser. 

206 Sheep desc:

Baaahthazär loves your hairdo. But this sad lizard has tangled hair. He tells you it itches.

207 Geyser desc:

It bubbles and froths all day long, providing your Hōm with energy.

“Help, Space Explorer. I am a very sad goat. My tummy hurts!”

212 Sheep dialog success:

213 House interaction:
Hygiene is important. You pack an overnight kit, in case you find a way to reach escape velocity. It contains: A brush, strawberry-flavored toothpaste, and a teddy bear.

214 Forest interaction:
You pick up a decent stick here, in case you want to roast marshmallows later.

215 Garden interaction:
Carrots. You hate carrots. Just looking at them makes you want to rip them from the ground. In fact, you think you will!



Little Būg Planet (300)

301 Forest of Rain

Here there are clouds propped up on sticks, crying their eternal tears of... joy. The locals have another name for this place, "Atmosphere Scrubberville," but you will call it, The Forest of Rain.

302 Mushrooms

You have never seen mushrooms before, but you read about them in dusty tomes. Here before you lies an entire field of them, growing in the sun.


303 

There are many things growing on this planet. Including this river of flowers. They sparkle with glimmer and compete with one another in beauty pageants.


304 Geyser desc:

It bubbles and froths all day long, preventing Būg Planet from breaking the second law of wormodynamics.

306


The bee is an opera singer and wants the flower as an accolade for their great singing.

Bee:
“I have sung the highest note there is to sing, to the largest audience on Būg. Yet no one has applauded or given me any recognition. I dream of carrying a bouquet of flowers off-stage.”

Flowers:
You can't bear to pick these flowers, for then they shall die in the full bloom of life. However, you figure taking a few of their flower-eggs can't hurt. And they can't really do anything to stop you.



"A Space Explorer, huh?" He tells you of rumors of an ancient lost world.




Dynō (400)



I used to be a Space Explorer like you…
But then they stopped making oxy helmets in my size.





Brōnto hates strawberries.



A strangely glowing rock feel from the sky. Where did it come from? It tastes like mint.
